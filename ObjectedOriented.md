### Chapter 1
Intro

#### Video 1

#### Video 2
[System definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory)
-  An organized entity made up of interrelated and interdependent parts

#### Video 3
Structure

#### Video 4
Model

#### Video 5
Engineering Model
- Abstract
- Understandable
- Simulatable
- Precise
- Predictable: can use to predict the behavior of the system
- Cheap
- Realizeable

Cannot be proved. Can only be tested

#### Video 6
Different OOD model:
- Peter Coad
- Grady Booch
- Ivar Jacobson

Workflow
1. Needs model
2. Analysis model
3. Design model

#### Video 7
Method = model + process

UML

Language:
- Syntax
- Semantics
- Pragmatics

Difference
- Concrect Syntax: use graph or xml to represent a model
- Abstract Syntax: use Class, Association to reprensent a model
- Semantics: the real meaning

#### Video 8
Methods:
- Structure: Data flow + preceeding
- E-R: Relation between static entities
- Finite Status Machine: event driven. Good for concurent, or complicate behavior
- Rules: Good for game theory
  - uniform game tree
  - Backtracking
- formalize: Flowchart
  - Hoare logic
  - petri net 
  - Process Algebra

#### Video 9
OOD design paradigm
- Real world
- Needs analysis
- System Analysis
- System Design
- OO languange
- non-OO language
- Assembly language
- Computer

Why and how to extend UML

BACS(or Backus?) UML Diagram

Class diagram

UML Profile: the extended UML. Can be downloaded from OMG

SysML

#### Video 12, 13
Meta: control, describe

Backus Naur Form: `::= |`

Meta model: 4 layers
- M0: Objects
- M1: Model
- M2: Meta-Model

UML OCL: to describe classes with context relation

UML extension method:
- UML 1.x
  - Stereotypes
  - Constraints
  - Tagged Values
- UML 2.0
  - Profile
  - Meta model

#### Video 14
MDA:
- procedural technology: Pascal, C
- object tecnology: Smalltalk, c++
- component technology: packages, framworks, patterns
- model technology: meta-models, xml, uml, MOF, XMI, XSLT

### Chapter 2

#### Video 1
Modeling element
- Class
- Relation
- Properity
- Operation
- Inherit
- Aggration
- Message

Principle
- Abstract
- Classify
- Encapsulation
- Inherit
- Aggration
- Relation
- Message communication: objects can only use message to complicate with other objects
- Grading control: package
- Behavior analysis: all behaviors belones to some class

#### Video 2
OOA: analysis
- Needs model
- Basic model: classes
  - Object layer
  - Characteristic layer
  - Relation layer
- Aid model
  - package graph
  - order graph
  - active graph
  - FSM

OOD: design
- problem domain
- UI
- Data API: persist
- Control driver

#### Video 3
Modeling process
1. Needs model
  - system border
  - participant
  - use case
2. basic model
  - objects
  - characteristics of objects
  - relation between objects
3. Aid model

#### Video 4
Books OOA and OOD written by Coad and Yourdon

Model-driven architecture (MDA) raised by Object Management Group (OMG)

From Platform-independent model (PIM) to Platform-specific model (PSM)

#### Video 5, 6
Use case analysis: can use a tree to define use cases and their sub use cases. Root is participant
- include relation: the sub use case always happen
- extend relation: not always happen
- generic relation

#### Video 7, 8, 9
System duty vs problem domain

Relation includes
- aggration relation
- entirety-partial relation

Diagrams
- A class diagram
- A Sequence diagram
- An activation diagram

Sync or Async message

#### Video 10, 11, Video 12
UI and Control driver design

- Identify passive class(send out message and control other classes)
- use process or thread

Control flow

I/O intensive vs CPU intensive

### Chapter 3

#### Video 1, 2, 3
Object vs Subject

Object is an instance of a Class

Properties and Methods

#### Video 4
Object based: cannot derive new classes
- Javascript
- OCL

#### Video 5
encapsulate
- combine properties and operations together
- avoid outside objects directly modify inner properties
- information hidden: make static, unchangable services public (public, private, protected, friend)


Process oriented: only operations

ER diagram: only properties

#### Video 6
Instantiation

Abstract Data Type (ADT): used by Ada and CLU

#### Video 7, 8
Message passing
- The explaination of the message is owned by receiver
- function override, polymorphism, code reuse all need message passing mechanism

There is a delay to pass message to another object

#### Video 9, 10, 11
generics and polymorphism

Generic
- inherit

polymorphism
- override
- interface reuse

override: replace an implementation with specific cases; is polymorphism, use dynamic link. Use virtual table to implement. Expensive

overload: different functions with a same name; not polymorphism, use static link

overwrite: put something else in the place, like rewrite a file. not related here. 

function signature vs prototype

#### Video 12
Association and Aggration

Association
- The relationship between objects
- Dependency relation is not association

Aggration
- Entire-partial relation

### Chapter 4
#### Video 1, 2

Function decomposition methods
- Structure design: data flow diagram
- Information modeling: E-R diagram. Entity and relation. Both of them are defined by properties

### Chapter 5
#### Video 1
use case diagram

1. Define border of the system: how outer objects can interact with the system, don't think about how system provide those business functions
2. Find actors
3. Find usecase

From actor point of view

#### Video 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Actor send request to system
- system ask actor to provide services

Actors can have generic relation between actors

Strategy to identify actors
- The human class that directly interact with the system
- Outer systems
- Devices, if the system we develop needs to deal with them
- External events, e.g. time event, that needs the system to responce

Use case: the description of how the actors use one function of the system. Is a special sequence of transaction

Actors can have association relation with use cases

One use case can associate with two actors. It doesn't mean two actors have generic relation. It means two actors both involve in this use case.

**Extend**: relation between use case and use case. A points to B means A is a generic use case, while B is some special cases of A. B has extension point to describe the special condition of it.

**Include**: Use case A points to B means A include the behavior of use case B.

**Generic**: The sub use case can overload some behavior of super use case
