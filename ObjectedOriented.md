### Chapter 1
Intro

#### Video 1

#### Video 2
[System definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory)
-  An organized entity made up of interrelated and interdependent parts

#### Video 3
Structure

#### Video 4
Model

#### Video 5
Engineering Model
- Abstract
- Understandable
- Simulatable
- Precise
- Predictable: can use to predict the behavior of the system
- Cheap
- Realizeable

Cannot be proved. Can only be tested

#### Video 6
Different OOD model:
- Peter Coad
- Grady Booch
- Ivar Jacobson

Workflow
1. Needs model
2. Analysis model
3. Design model

#### Video 7
Method = model + process

UML

Language:
- Syntax
- Semantics
- Pragmatics

Difference
- Concrect Syntax: use graph or xml to represent a model
- Abstract Syntax: use Class, Association to reprensent a model
- Semantics: the real meaning

#### Video 8
Methods:
- Structure: Data flow + preceeding
- E-R: Relation between static entities
- Finite Status Machine: event driven. Good for concurent, or complicate behavior
- Rules: Good for game theory
  - uniform game tree
  - Backtracking
- formalize: Flowchart
  - Hoare logic
  - petri net 
  - Process Algebra

#### Video 12, 13
Meta: control, describe

Backus Naur Form: `::= |`

Meta model: 4 layers
- M0: Objects
- M1: Model
- M2: Meta-Model

UML OCL: to describe classes with context relation

UML extension method:
- UML 1.x
  - Stereotypes
  - Constraints
  - Tagged Values
- UML 2.0
  - Profile
  - Meta model

#### Video 14

### Chapter 2

#### Video 1
Modeling element
- Class
- Relation
- Properity
- Operation
- Inherit
- Aggration
- Message

Principle
- Abstract
- Classify
- Encapsulation
- Inherit
- Aggration
- Relation
- Message communication: objects can only use message to complicate with other objects
- Grading control: package
- Behavior analysis: all behaviors belones to some class

#### Video 2
OOA: analysis
- Needs model
- Basic model: classes
  - Object layer
  - Characteristic layer
  - Relation layer
- Aid model
  - package graph
  - order graph
  - active graph
  - FSM

OOD: design
- problem domain
- UI
- Data API: persist
- Control driver

#### Video 3
Modeling process
1. Needs model
  - system border
  - participant
  - use case
2. basic model
  - objects
  - characteristics of objects
  - relation between objects
3. Aid model

#### Video 4
Books OOA and OOD written by Coad and Yourdon

Model-driven architecture (MDA) raised by Object Management Group (OMG)

From Platform-independent model (PIM) to Platform-specific model (PSM)

#### Video 5, 6
Use case analysis: can use a tree to define use cases and their sub use cases. Root is participant
- include relation: the sub use case always happen
- extend relation: not always happen
- generic relation

#### Video 7, 8, 9
System duty vs problem domain

Relation includes
- aggration relation
- entirety-partial relation

Diagrams
- A class diagram
- A Sequence diagram
- An activation diagram

Sync or Async message

#### Video 10, 11, Video 12
UI and Control driver design

- Identify passive class(send out message and control other classes)
- use process or thread

Control flow

I/O intensive vs CPU intensive

### Chapter 3

#### Video 1, 2, 3
Object vs Subject

Object is an instance of a Class

Properties and Methods

#### Video 4
Object based: cannot derive new classes
- Javascript
- OCL

#### Video 5
encapsulate
- combine properties and operations together
- avoid outside objects directly modify inner properties
- information hidden: make static, unchangable services public (public, private, protected, friend)


Process oriented: only operations

ER diagram: only properties

#### Video 6
Instantiation

Abstract Data Type (ADT): used by Ada and CLU

#### Video 7, 8
Message passing
- The explaination of the message is owned by receiver
- function override, polymorphism, code reuse all need message passing mechanism

There is a delay to pass message to another object

#### Video 9, 10, 11
generics and polymorphism

Generic
- inherit

polymorphism
- override
- interface reuse

override: replace an implementation with specific cases; is polymorphism, use dynamic link. Use virtual table to implement. Expensive

overload: different functions with a same name; not polymorphism, use static link

overwrite: put something else in the place, like rewrite a file. not related here. 

function signature vs prototype

#### Video 12
Association and Aggration

Association
- The relationship between objects
- Dependency relation is not association

Aggration
- Entire-partial relation

### Chapter 4

### Chapter 5
#### Video 1
use case diagram

1. Define border of the system: how outer objects can interact with the system, don't think about how system provide those business functions
2. Find actors
3. Find usecase

From actor point of view

#### Video 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Actor send request to system
- system ask actor to provide services

Actors can have generic relation between actors

Strategy to identify actors
- The human class that directly interact with the system
- Outer systems
- Devices, if the system we develop needs to deal with them
- External events, e.g. time event, that needs the system to responce

Use case: the description of how the actors use one function of the system. Is a special sequence of transaction

Actors can have association relation with use cases

One use case can associate with two actors. It doesn't mean two actors have generic relation. It means two actors both involve in this use case.

**Extend**: relation between use case and use case. A points to B means A is a generic use case, while B is some special cases of A. B has extension point to describe the special condition of it.

**Include**: Use case A points to B means A include the behavior of use case B.

**Generic**: The sub use case can overload some behavior of super use case

#### Video 7
Use cases include both success cases and failure cases

Use case needs to describe 1. what are actors' cases, 2. what are system cases

#### Video 8, 9
Group use cases into packages

Object Diagram

#### Video 2, 3
CRC card to find system responsibilities
- each card is a class
- first define responsibilities of a class
- if those responsibities cannot be done by this class only, create a new card as helper

Review and discard some useless objects

Properties of a class cannot relate to another class. Create a relation class.

#### Video 4
**Generization**: is a

Power type & stereotype

#### Video 5
**Association**: zero or one-to-zero or one, one-to-one, one-to-many, many to many(try to avoid many-to-many, use one-to-one instead)

**Direct Association**: From A can access B but from B cannot access A

#### Video 6
If an association has properties, can use a class to describe it

Extended association types
- Qualifier: avoid many-to-many relation. break it into two one-to-many relation
- XOR: either relate to this or that
- Ordered

Two ways to implement association
- message passing
- database store args

#### Video 7
**Analysis pattern(Martin Fowler)**
- Accountability: Party, organization hierarchies, Organization structure, 
- Observation and measurements
- Rederring to objects

#### Video 8
**Aggregation**: has a

**Composition**: one of aggregation. All composites combine to be an entire part.

There are some case which can both use aggregation and generization. If one instance of the subclass can change into another class, use aggregation is better.

#### Video 9
**Dependency**: all other relations
- access: message passing
- derive
- import
- refine
- trace
- use
- include
- extend

**Interface realization**

Iterfaces between 
- processes: OCL
- languages: IDL
- hosts: ejb, com, dcom

#### Video 10
package diagram

import vs access

visibility:
- `+`: public
- `#`: protected
- `-`: private
- `~`: only elements in the same package can access


### Chapter 7

#### Video 1
Interaction diagram

Intro
- good at describe control flow and data flow
- good at describe static activity
- not good at describe event driven, dynamic activity

Diagrams
- Sequence diagram
- Communication diagram
- ?
- ?

#### Video 2
Sequence diagram
- object
- lifecycle line: contains both active state and hibernate state of an object
- activate
- message

Message
- Syncronized message: block the sender thread until get response
- Async message: in buffer
- return message

#### Video 3
Inorder system
- Messages are sync messages
- each message only have one receiver

Concurrent system

#### Video 4, 5
Async message: To receiver, the message is an event

UML define this kind of message as signal, which only has properties, but not methods

UML 2.0
- message occurrence
- execution occurrence
- interaction fragment
- combined fragment
- formal gates
- actual gates
- expression gates

#### Video 6
- Communication diagram
- Interaction abstract diagram
- Timing diagram
