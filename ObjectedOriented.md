# Objected Oriented

## Grokking the low level design interview using OOD principles

### Knowledges

OOP principles

- Encapsulation
- Abstration
- Inheritance: inherit all the non-private properties/methods
  - types: single inheritance, multiple inheritance (more than 1 base class), multi-level inheritance, hierarchical inheritance, hybrid inheritance
- Polymorphism: many forms.
  - types: dynamic: method overriding (same name, var, return between two classes), static: method + operator overload(same name different var with in a same class)

UML:

- things
- relationships
- diagrams
  - structural
  - Behavioral: case diagrams, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams

Relationships

1. association
2. generalization: inheritance
3. include
4. extend

Object Association

1. simple association
2. composition
3. aggregation: objects can exist independently

Dependency

Sequence diagram

- lifeline
- activation bars
- messages

Activity diagram

SOLID

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open/Closed Principle: open for extension but closed for modification. Use inherit not directly modify
- Liskov Substitution princile: superclass should be replaceable by subclasses
- Interface Segregation Principle: fine-grained interfaces. Have group of used interfaces not fat interfaces with useless methods
- Dependency Inversion Principle: high level modules should not dependent on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstrations

Design patterns

- creational
- structual
- behavioral
- achitectrual

Creational design patterns

- factory
- constructor
- singleton
- builder
- prototype
- abstract

structual design patterns

- decroator
- facade
- adapter
- bridge: ?
- composite
- flyweight: use context with cache to share across different compoents
  - intrinsic
  - extrinsic
- proxy

behavioral design pattern

- chain of responsibitlity: a request either handled or passed
- command: ?
- iterator
- mediator: central authority
- observer: notification
- vistor: ?
- interpreter pattern
- template pattern
- memento pattern
- state pattern
- strategy pattern: use interface and override

Architectural design patterns

- MVC
- MVP
- MVVM

Real problem

1. Collecting requirements
2. scope down the problem
3. SOLID: easy to extend

Model the problem: establish the classes and their relationships

### Parking lot

1. payment flexibility
2. parking spot type
3. vehicle types
4. pricing

Requirements

1. park 40k cars
2. types of spots: hanicapped, compact, large, motorcycle
3. multiple entrance and exit
4. types of cars: car, truck, van, motorcycle
5. a display board shows free parking spots
6. customers collect a ticket from the entrance, pay at exit
7. pay with either automated exit panel or pay the parking agent at exit
8. payment is calculated at an hourly rate.
9. payment made using either a credit/debit card or cash

Actors

1. customer: take/scan/pay ticket
2. parking agent
3. admin: add/remove/update a spot, agent, entry/exit panels. Modify hourly rate, view/update account (customer)
4. system: giving details of parking spot. assigning parking spots to vehicles

### Elevator System

Consideration

1. how many elevators
2. wait time and running cost
3. how passengers see the status of elevator

Design pattern

1. strategy
2. state
3. delegation

Requirements

1. 15 floors, 3 elevators
2. move up or down or in idle state
3. door open in idle state
4. elevator passes through each floor
5. a button to call elevator car, up and down
6. panel inside elevator have buttons to go to every floor, and open/close doors
7. display in and out shows the current floor and the direction
8. inside display shows capacity

Actors

1. passengers
2. system

Use cases

1. press panel button
2. move/stop elevator
3. dispatcher algorithm
4. display
5. open/close door
6. request for elevator
7. fllor request
8. call emergency

Dispatching algorithms

1. First Come First Serve: 4 states: elevator idle; elevator moving towards passenger and same direction; moving towards and wrong direction; moving away. Use a queue to track which passenger comes first
2. Shortest Seek Time First: passenger who is closest to the elevator gets it
3. SCAN: always go up to the top then go down to bottom
4. LOOK: advanced SCAN

### Library management system

Use cases

1. book info: # of copies of a book, position, name + attributes
2. renewal extend borrow
3. fine
4. book reservation
5. barcode scanner

Design pattern

- facotry
- delegation: delegate a task from one class to another
- observer: notify after a book is available

### Amazon locker service

Considerations

1. Locker size
2. Locker selection: not double booked
3. Lock status: time constraint for package kept in the locker
4. return an item using a locker
5. code

Design patterns

1. strategy
2. repository

actors

1. customer
2. delivery guy
3. system

Model-driven architecture (MDA) raised by Object Management Group (OMG)

From Platform-independent model (PIM) to Platform-specific model (PSM)

#### Chapter 2 Video 5, 6

Use case analysis: can use a tree to define use cases and their sub use cases. Root is participant

- include relation: the sub use case always happen
- extend relation: not always happen
- generic relation

#### Chapter 2 Video 7, 8, 9

System duty vs problem domain

Relation includes

- aggration relation
- entirety-partial relation

Diagrams

- A class diagram
- A Sequence diagram
- An activation diagram

Sync or Async message

#### Chapter 2 Video 10, 11, Video 12

UI and Control driver design

- Identify passive class(send out message and control other classes)
- use process or thread

Control flow

I/O intensive vs CPU intensive

### Chapter 3

#### Chapter 3 Video 1, 2, 3

Object vs Subject

Object is an instance of a Class

Properties and Methods

#### Chapter 3 Video 4

Object based: cannot derive new classes

- Javascript
- OCL

#### Chapter 3 Video 5

encapsulate

- combine properties and operations together
- avoid outside objects directly modify inner properties
- information hidden: make static, unchangable services public (public, private, protected, friend)

Process oriented: only operations

ER diagram: only properties

#### Chapter 3 Video 6

Instantiation

Abstract Data Type (ADT): used by Ada and CLU

#### Chapter 3 Video 7, 8

Message passing

- The explaination of the message is owned by receiver
- function override, polymorphism, code reuse all need message passing mechanism

There is a delay to pass message to another object

#### Chapter 3 Video 9, 10, 11

generics and polymorphism

Generic

- inherit

polymorphism

- override
- interface reuse

override: replace an implementation with specific cases; is polymorphism, use dynamic link. Use virtual table to implement. Expensive

overload: different functions with a same name; not polymorphism, use static link

overwrite: put something else in the place, like rewrite a file. not related here.

function signature vs prototype

#### Chapter 3 Video 12

Association and Aggration

Association

- The relationship between objects
- Dependency relation is not association

Aggration

- Entire-partial relation

use case diagram

1. Define border of the system: how outer objects can interact with the system, don't think about how system provide those business functions
2. Find actors
3. Find usecase

From actor point of view

#### Chapter 5 Video 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

- Actor send request to system
- system ask actor to provide services

Actors can have generic relation between actors

Strategy to identify actors

- The human class that directly interact with the system
- Outer systems
- Devices, if the system we develop needs to deal with them
- External events, e.g. time event, that needs the system to responce

Use case: the description of how the actors use one function of the system. Is a special sequence of transaction

Actors can have association relation with use cases

One use case can associate with two actors. It doesn't mean two actors have generic relation. It means two actors both involve in this use case.

**Extend**: relation between use case and use case. A points to B means A is a generic use case, while B is some special cases of A. B has extension point to describe the special condition of it.

**Include**: Use case A points to B means A include the behavior of use case B.

**Generic**: The sub use case can overload some behavior of super use case

#### Chapter 5 Video 7

Use cases include both success cases and failure cases

Use case needs to describe 1. what are actors' cases, 2. what are system cases

#### Chapter 5 Video 8, 9

CRC card to find system responsibilities

- each card is a class
- first define responsibilities of a class
- if those responsibities cannot be done by this class only, create a new card as helper

Review and discard some useless objects

Properties of a class cannot relate to another class. Create a relation class.

#### Chapter 6 Video 4

**Generization**: is a

Power type & stereotype

#### Chapter 6 Video 5

**Association**: zero or one-to-zero or one, one-to-one, one-to-many, many to many(try to avoid many-to-many, use one-to-one instead)

**Direct Association**: From A can access B but from B cannot access A

#### Chapter 6 Video 6

If an association has properties, can use a class to describe it

Extended association types

- Qualifier: avoid many-to-many relation. break it into two one-to-many relation
- XOR: either relate to this or that
- Ordered

Two ways to implement association

- message passing
- database store args

#### Chapter 6 Video 7

**Analysis pattern** (Martin Fowler)

- Accountability: Party, organization hierarchies, Organization structure
- Observation and measurements
- Rederring to objects

#### Chapter 6 Video 8

**Aggregation**: has a

**Composition**: one of aggregation. All composites combine to be an entire part.

There are some case which can both use aggregation and generization. If one instance of the subclass can change into another class, use aggregation is better.

#### Chapter 6 Video 9

**Dependency**: all other relations

- access: message passing
- derive
- import
- refine
- trace
- use
- include
- extend

**Interface realization**:

Iterfaces between

- processes: OCL
- languages: IDL
- hosts: ejb, com, dcom

import vs access

visibility:

- `+`: public

#### Chapter 7 Video 3

Inorder system

- Messages are sync messages
- each message only have one receiver

Concurrent system

#### Chapter 7 Video 4, 5

Async message: To receiver, the message is an event

UML define this kind of message as signal, which only has properties, but not methods
