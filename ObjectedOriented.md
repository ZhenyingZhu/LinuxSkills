#### Video 2
[System definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory)
-  An organized entity made up of interrelated and interdependent parts

#### Video 3
Structure

#### Video 4
Model

#### Video 5
Engineering Model
- Abstract
- Understandable
- Simulatable
- Precise
- Predictable: can use to predict the behavior of the system
- Cheap
- Realizeable

Cannot be proved. Can only be tested

#### Video 6
Different OOD model:
- Peter Coad
- Grady Booch
- Ivar Jacobson

Workflow
1. Needs model
2. Analysis model
3. Design model

#### Video 7
Method = model + process

UML

Language:
- Syntax
- Semantics
- Pragmatics

Difference
- Concrect Syntax: use graph or xml to represent a model
- Abstract Syntax: use Class, Association to reprensent a model
- Semantics: the real meaning

#### Video 8
Methods:
- Structure: Data flow + preceeding
- E-R: Relation between static entities
- Finite Status Machine: event driven. Good for concurent, or complicate behavior
- Rules: Good for game theory
  - uniform game tree
  - Backtracking
- formalize: Flowchart
  - Hoare logic
  - petri net 
  - Process Algebra

#### Video 9
OOD design paradigm
- Real world
- Needs analysis
- System Analysis
- System Design
- OO languange
- non-OO language
- Assembly language
- Computer

Why and how to extend UML

BACS(or Backus?) UML Diagram

Class diagram

UML Profile: the extended UML. Can be downloaded from OMG

SysML

#### Video 12, 13
Meta: control, describe

Backus Naur Form: `::= |`

Meta model: 4 layers
- M0: Objects
- M1: Model
- M2: Meta-Model

UML OCL: to describe classes with context relation

UML extension method:
- UML 1.x
  - Stereotypes
  - Constraints
  - Tagged Values
- UML 2.0
  - Profile
  - Meta model
