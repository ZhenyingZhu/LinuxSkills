### Chapter 1
Intro

#### Video 1

#### Video 2
[System definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory)
-  An organized entity made up of interrelated and interdependent parts

#### Video 3
Structure

#### Video 4
Model

#### Video 5
Engineering Model
- Abstract
- Understandable
- Simulatable
- Precise
- Predictable: can use to predict the behavior of the system
- Cheap
- Realizeable

Cannot be proved. Can only be tested

#### Video 6
Different OOD model:
- Peter Coad
- Grady Booch
- Ivar Jacobson

Workflow
1. Needs model
2. Analysis model
3. Design model

#### Video 7
Method = model + process

UML

Language:
- Syntax
- Semantics
- Pragmatics

Difference
- Concrect Syntax: use graph or xml to represent a model
- Abstract Syntax: use Class, Association to reprensent a model
- Semantics: the real meaning

#### Video 8
Methods:
- Structure: Data flow + preceeding
- E-R: Relation between static entities
- Finite Status Machine: event driven. Good for concurent, or complicate behavior
- Rules: Good for game theory
  - uniform game tree
  - Backtracking
- formalize: Flowchart
  - Hoare logic
  - petri net 
  - Process Algebra

#### Video 9
OOD design paradigm
- Real world
- Needs analysis
- System Analysis
- System Design
- OO languange
- non-OO language
- Assembly language
- Computer

#### Video 10, 11
Why and how to extend UML

BACS(or Backus?) UML Diagram

Class diagram

UML Profile: the extended UML. Can be downloaded from OMG

SysML

#### Video 12, 13
Meta: control, describe

Backus Naur Form: `::= |`

Meta model: 4 layers
- M0: Objects
- M1: Model
- M2: Meta-Model

UML OCL: to describe classes with context relation

UML extension method:
- UML 1.x
  - Stereotypes
  - Constraints
  - Tagged Values
- UML 2.0
  - Profile
  - Meta model

#### Video 14
MDA:
- procedural technology: Pascal, C
- object tecnology: Smalltalk, c++
- component technology: packages, framworks, patterns
- model technology: meta-models, xml, uml, MOF, XMI, XSLT

### Chapter 2

#### Video 1
Modeling element
- Class
- Relation
- Properity
- Operation
- Inherit
- Aggration
- Message

Principle
- Abstract
- Classify
- Encapsulation
- Inherit
- Aggration
- Relation
- Message communication: objects can only use message to complicate with other objects
- Grading control: package
- Behavior analysis: all behaviors belones to some class

#### Video 2
OOA: analysis
- Needs model
- Basic model: classes
  - Object layer
  - Characteristic layer
  - Relation layer
- Aid model
  - package graph
  - order graph
  - active graph
  - FSM

OOD: design
- problem domain
- UI
- Data API: persist
- Control driver

#### Video 3
Modeling process
1. Needs model
  - system border
  - participant
  - use case
2. basic model
  - objects
  - characteristics of objects
  - relation between objects
3. Aid model

#### Video 4
Books OOA and OOD written by Coad and Yourdon

Model-driven architecture (MDA) raised by Object Management Group (OMG)

From Platform-independent model (PIM) to Platform-specific model (PSM)

#### Video 5, 6
Use case analysis: can use a tree to define use cases and their sub use cases. Root is participant
- include relation: the sub use case always happen
- extend relation: not always happen
- generic relation

#### Video 7, 8, 9
System duty vs problem domain

Relation includes
- aggration relation
- entirety-partial relation

Diagrams
- A class diagram
- A Sequence diagram
- An activation diagram

Sync or Async message

#### Video 10, 11, Video 12
UI and Control driver design

- Identify passive class(send out message and control other classes)
- use process or thread

Control flow

I/O intensive vs CPU intensive

### Chapter 3
#### Video 1, 2, 3
Object vs Subject

Object is an instance of a Class

Properties and Methods

#### Video 4
Object based: cannot derive new classes
- Javascript
- OCL

#### Video 5
encapsulate
- combine properties and operations together
- avoid outside objects directly modify inner properties
- information hidden: make static, unchangable services public (public, private, protected, friend)


Process oriented: only operations

ER diagram: only properties

#### Video 6
Instantiation

Abstract Data Type (ADT): used by Ada and CLU

#### Video 7, 8
Message passing
- The explaination of the message is owned by receiver
- function override, polymorphism, code reuse all need message passing mechanism

There is a delay to pass message to another object

#### Video 9, 10, 11
generics and polymorphism

Genertic
- inherit

polymorphism
- override
- interface reuse

override: replace an implementation with specific cases; is polymorphism, use dynamic link. Use virtual table to implement. Expensive

overload: different functions with a same name; not polymorphism, use static link

overwrite: put something else in the place, like rewrite a file. not related here. 

function signature vs prototype

#### Video 12
Association and Aggration

Association
- The relationship between objects
- Dependency relation is not association

Aggration
- Entire-partial relation

### Chapter 4
#### Video 1, 2
Book chapter 2

Function decomposition methods
- Structure design: data flow diagram
- Information modeling: E-R diagram. Entity and relation. Both of them are defined by properties

#### Video 3
Problem domain

System responsibilities
