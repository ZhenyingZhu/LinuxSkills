Server Roles and Technologies

- Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS): build a public key infrastructure (PKI).
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS): user and resource management, and provide support for directory-enabled applications such as Microsoft Exchange Server.
- Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS): provide secured identity [federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity) and SSO.
- Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services: a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). A thiner implementation of AD DS.
- Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS): create reliable information protection solutions.
- Application Server: deploying and running custom, server-based business applications.
- Desktop Experience: Graphical Management Tools.
- Failover Clustering: manage VM and nodes failover.
- File and Storage Services.
- Group Policy.
- Hyper-V.
- Networking: for IT professional to design, deploy, and maintain Windows Server 2012.
- Network Load Balancing (NLB): enhances the availability and scalability of Internet server applications such as those used on web, FTP, firewall, proxy, virtual private network (VPN), and other mission-critical servers.
- Network Policy and Access Services: Network Policy Server (NPS), Health Registration Authority (HRA), and Host Credential Authorization Protocol (HCAP).
- Print and Document Services: including Print Server, Distributed Scan Server, and Fax Server.
- Remote Desktop Services: enables both a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and session-based desktops.
- Security and Protection.
- Telemetry: send feedback to Microsoft.
- Volume Activation: deploy and manage volume licenses for a medium to large number of computers.
- Web Server (IIS).
- Windows Deployment Services: deploy Windows operating systems over the network.
- Windows Server Backup Feature.
- Windows Server Essentials Experience: such as simplified management using the server dashboard, data protection, Remote Web Access, and integration with Microsoft online servicesâ€”all.
- Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).
- Windows System Resource Manager: manage server processor and memory usage with standard or custom resource policies. Help ensure that all the services provided by a single server are available on an equal basis.

### AD LDS

[Overview for 2012](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/hh831593(v=ws.11))

[Overview2 for 2008 and 2012](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc733064(v=ws.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)

- AD LDS provides data storage and retrieval for directory-enabled applications.
- provides much of the same functionality as AD DS, but it does not require the deployment of domains or domain controllers.
- Both AD LDS and AD DS build on the same core Microsoft directory service technologies.
- AD DS provides directory services for both the Windows server operating system and for directory-enabled applications. AD DS must adhere to a single schema throughout an entire forest.
- AD LDS can run multiple instances concurrently on a single computer, with an independently managed schema for each AD LDS instance.
- in environments where AD DS exists, AD LDS can use AD DS for the authentication of Windows security principals.
- A directory-enabled application uses a directory to hold data, rather than a database.
- Examples: customer relationship management (CRM) applications, human resource (HR) applications, and global address book applications.
- Directory services are optimized for read processing, while relational databases are optimized for transaction processing.
- directory services also provide such benefits as distributed architecture (multimaster design, replication, and geographical scalability); storage of identity data that is common to applications and platforms throughout an enterprise; flexible data schema; and fine-grained access policies.

A replica of an existing AD LDS instance contains replicated copies of the configuration and schema directory partitions, including any schema extensions.

LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) files: importing schema definitions into an instance. transfer objects between Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and AD LDS partitions.

AD LDS server stores its database file and the associated log files in an instance-specific directory.

[Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc753742(v=ws.11))

- service instance: a single running copy of AD LDS.
- each instance has a separate directory data store, a unique service name, and a unique service description.
- an instance can be part of a configuration set that provides replication of instance data to instances that run on separate servers.
- AD LDS provides
  - a hierarchical data store: adamntds.dit
  - a directory service component: dsmain.exe, adamdsa.dll
  - an client interfaces: LDAP, replication
- AD LDS does not require a domain controller or a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
- multimaster replication: grouping AD LDS instances into configuration sets.

[AD LDS Schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc753882(v=ws.11))

- Each AD LDS configuration set has its own independently manageable schema, which is stored in the schema directory partition.
- the base (or default) AD LDS schema contains only the classes and attributes that are needed to start an AD LDS instance.
- The schema can be extended with new classes and attributes, either by administrators or by the applications themselves.
- Can define either Object classes or Attributes
- Both single-valued and multivalued attributes can be indexed. classes cannot be indexed.
- wildcards search string can only used on indexed attributes

[AD Schema and all pre-defined](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/active-directory-schema)

- property == attribute.
- 3 distinct categories of classes: Structural Classes, Abstract Classes, and Auxiliary Classes.
- Content rules: expressed by the Must-Contain and May-Contain attributes of the schema definitions for each class.
- Directory Information Tree (DIT): the class instances stored in a tree structure
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Internet communications protocol.
- Object: a Class-Schema object and a group of Attribute-Schema
- Object Identifier ((OIDs)): uniquely identify data elements, syntaxes, and various other parts of distributed applications. a dotted string of numbers, like "1.2.840.113556.1.5.4
- Schema: defines the Poss-Superiors (defines what classes can be parents), Must-Contain, and May-Contain attributes.
- Security Descriptor: ownership of an object and the permissions
- Structure Rules: expressed by the Poss-superiors
- X.500: specify the naming, data representation, and communications protocols for a directory service.

- objectClass: can be classSchema, attributeSchema
- cn: the schame name
- Dn == distinguishedName, a chain of cns.

[Schema related info in AD Doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/active-directory-schema)

- Each attribute is described by an attributeSchema
- definition: includes a variety of data, i.e. what object types that the attribute applies to; the syntax type of the attribute.
- Domain-replicated, stored attributes: some attributes are stored in the directory and eplicated to all domain controllers in a domain, like [cn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-cn), [objectGUID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-objectguid). A subset of these attributes is also replicated to the global catalog.
- Non-replicated, locally stored attributes, such as badPwdCount, Last-Logon, and Last-Logoff are stored on each domain controller, but are not replicated. to obtain the last time that a user logged on to the domain, retrieve the Last-Logon attribute for the user from every domain controller in the domain and find that latest date and time.
- Non-stored, constructed attributes: calculated by the domain controller
