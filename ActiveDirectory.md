Server Roles and Technologies

- Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS): build a public key infrastructure (PKI).
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS): user and resource management, and provide support for directory-enabled applications such as Microsoft Exchange Server.
- Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS): provide secured identity [federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity) and SSO.
- Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services: a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). A thiner implementation of AD DS.
- Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS): create reliable information protection solutions.
- Application Server: deploying and running custom, server-based business applications.
- Desktop Experience: Graphical Management Tools.
- Failover Clustering: manage VM and nodes failover.
- File and Storage Services.
- Group Policy.
- Hyper-V.
- Networking: for IT professional to design, deploy, and maintain Windows Server 2012.
- Network Load Balancing (NLB): enhances the availability and scalability of Internet server applications such as those used on web, FTP, firewall, proxy, virtual private network (VPN), and other mission-critical servers.
- Network Policy and Access Services: Network Policy Server (NPS), Health Registration Authority (HRA), and Host Credential Authorization Protocol (HCAP).
- Print and Document Services: including Print Server, Distributed Scan Server, and Fax Server.
- Remote Desktop Services: enables both a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and session-based desktops.
- Security and Protection.
- Telemetry: send feedback to Microsoft.
- Volume Activation: deploy and manage volume licenses for a medium to large number of computers.
- Web Server (IIS).
- Windows Deployment Services: deploy Windows operating systems over the network.
- Windows Server Backup Feature.
- Windows Server Essentials Experience: such as simplified management using the server dashboard, data protection, Remote Web Access, and integration with Microsoft online servicesâ€”all.
- Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).
- Windows System Resource Manager: manage server processor and memory usage with standard or custom resource policies. Help ensure that all the services provided by a single server are available on an equal basis.

### AD LDS

[Overview for 2012](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/hh831593(v=ws.11))

[Overview2 for 2008 and 2012](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc733064(v=ws.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)

- AD LDS provides data storage and retrieval for directory-enabled applications.
- provides much of the same functionality as AD DS, but it does not require the deployment of domains or domain controllers.
- Both AD LDS and AD DS build on the same core Microsoft directory service technologies.
- AD DS provides directory services for both the Windows server operating system and for directory-enabled applications. AD DS must adhere to a single schema throughout an entire forest.
- AD LDS can run multiple instances concurrently on a single computer, with an independently managed schema for each AD LDS instance.
- in environments where AD DS exists, AD LDS can use AD DS for the authentication of Windows security principals.
- A directory-enabled application uses a directory to hold data, rather than a database.
- Examples: customer relationship management (CRM) applications, human resource (HR) applications, and global address book applications.
- Directory services are optimized for read processing, while relational databases are optimized for transaction processing.
- directory services also provide such benefits as distributed architecture (multimaster design, replication, and geographical scalability); storage of identity data that is common to applications and platforms throughout an enterprise; flexible data schema; and fine-grained access policies.
