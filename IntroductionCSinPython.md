## Lecture 1
Turing's Halting Problem.  

- Declarative knowledge
- Imperative knowledge  

Square root of a number: `g^2 = x` find g
- guess g
- Test: if `g^2 ~= x`, return g
- Caculation: `g = 1/2(g + x/g)`
- Flow control

A special program, interpreter, execute each instruction of a program in order.  

Computer architecture:  
- Memory
- Control unit: include a program counter
- Arithmetic logic unit: include an accumulator
- Input 
- Output

Turing complete: six primitives can compute anything.   

Static semantics: even syntax is right, sometimes not has meaning

- Compiled language
- Interpreted language

Semantic errors can not be captured by computer.  
Defensive programming can avoid semantic errors.
