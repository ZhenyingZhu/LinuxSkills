Primitive call

```
(require 2htdp/image)
```

Define a function
```
(define (foo arg)
  (op arg))
```

### How to Design Functions
- How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe
- complete function design
- evaluate the different elements for clarity, simplicity and consistency with each other
- evaluate the entire design for how well it solves the given problem

- Signature, purpose, stub: write a function prototype, with correct return type, so it can pass to a test and fail
- Examples: write test cases, which cover all user cases
- Inventory (template & constants): template is the outline of the function
- Code body: verify if the code is correct or not
- Test and debug

Design process needs to deal with vague requirement. 

Use enought test cases to get code coverage
- All if normal cases
- boundary cases
